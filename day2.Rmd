# Day 2 at #adventofcode

## Part1

The riddle to solve is [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2). 


### Loading data 

```{r}
direction <- read.csv("data/day2", header = F, sep = " ")
names(direction) <- c("arrow", "unit")
```

### Moving the sub

I will try first to implement moving forward then I will add the two other options.

```{r}
horiz_pos <- sum(direction$unit[direction$arrow == "forward"])

horiz_pos
```


```{r}
depth <- sum(direction$unit[direction$arrow == "down"]) - sum(direction$unit[direction$arrow == "up"])

depth
```

```{r}
horiz_pos * depth
```
